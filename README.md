# NextJS Boilerplate

My frustration is that if I create a NextJS app I need to manually set up projects to use TypeScript, NextAuth, Prisma, etc and if I use T3 I have to refactor when they update versions that aren't backwards compatible (I can't seem to find a way to auto-upgrade). So I'm creating this boilerplate to try to create an encapsulated template for projects such that upgrading versions is backwards compatible thus requiring no maintenance by users themselves.
